Market Regime Detection Using Unsupervised Learning

This project focuses on detecting **market regimes** using unsupervised learning on order book and volume data. The objective is to identify distinct market conditions — such as **trending vs. mean-reverting**, **volatile vs. stable**, and **liquid vs. illiquid** — based on derived features including **liquidity**, **depth**, **volatility**, and **volume**.

Clustering techniques (e.g., `KMeans`) are used to uncover hidden patterns and segment the data into meaningful market states. This analysis helps visualize and understand how regimes evolve over time, providing actionable insights into market behavior and transitions.
